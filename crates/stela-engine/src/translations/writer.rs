//! The order in which a boot writes its pack file, a journal of segments and
//! used-key lists ([`super::pack`]), independent of the device: the boot
//! drives [`Writer::step`] on processors whose guest waits and
//! [`Writer::stop`] when the guest restarts or powers off, and hands each a
//! way to carry a journal plan out ([`Execution`]).
//!
//! While the guest runs, the entries the boot added go to the file as new
//! segments: the first once translation goes quiet (fewer than
//! [`QUIET_RATE`] entries a second for [`QUIET_SECONDS`]) or at
//! [`FIRST_DELTA_SECONDS`], whichever comes first, then at doubling
//! intervals; and whenever the entries held reach half their bound
//! ([`Entries::pressed`]), so none is refused for want of room while the
//! writer keeps up. Pressed while it writes or merges, it takes them at once
//! and holds them, one batch, for the segment it starts next.
//!
//! The newest two segments are merged, keeping every record and its age,
//! once the newer is at least half the older: segment sizes stay geometric,
//! so the slots ([`MAX_SEGMENTS`]) suffice for any amount and a record is
//! rewritten a logarithmic number of times. A full merge folds every
//! segment and used-key list into one, dropping records unused for too many
//! boots: once a boot when the file holds [`MERGE_AT`] of either (after the
//! boot's first segment came due, and while translation does not press),
//! when the segments fill half the file, when a new segment finds no room,
//! or when the slots run short. A merge reads segments from memory: those
//! the boot read and those it laid out, whose records it moves instead of
//! copying. Every merged segment lies beside the file's content, so it
//! commits once and a cut leaves the content before it whole; a full merge
//! stays within [`MERGED_SHARE`] of the file, so new segments find room
//! until the next. A new segment the file has no room for waits for a
//! merge; one that finds none even after it is too large for the file and
//! is left out.
//!
//! At a stop, a new segment's write in flight is finished, a merge not yet
//! committed is left, and what is left and the boot's used-key list are
//! written.
//!
//! Once a segment is written, its records move out of the heap to an arena
//! ([`Arena`]) outside it, as the pack the loader read is held, a step's
//! share ([`SETTLE_BYTES`]) at a time, whatever else it does: merges read
//! them there, and the heap keeps each laid-out segment's index alone. A
//! merge moves its inputs' records rather than copying them, and copies a
//! record several segments hold only when merging changes it; when the
//! arena fills, it is compacted to the records the segments keep, so it
//! holds what this boot added, not what merges left behind.
//!
//! A pack the next boot reads whole converges on the code boots use: a boot
//! leaves at most [`LEFT_EIGHTHS`] of the limit (the store sheds new entries
//! past it), so the next reads all of it and its arena, the limit less the
//! pack read, holds whatever it adds; and once a boot whose file held
//! records of earlier boots, a full merge keeps [`KEPT_EIGHTHS`] of the
//! limit, the records boots used most recently first, which leaves room for
//! the code the boot newly compiles.
//!
//! What stays in the heap, beside everything the guest and the GPU need
//! from it, the writer bounds by the heap
//! ([`Entries::heap`]): the store sheds new entries while the heap's room is
//! under [`SHED_SHARE`] or the laid-out segments reach [`RESIDENT_SHARE`]
//! of it, and once the room falls under [`RELEASE_SHARE`] the writer lets
//! every segment it holds go, for the rest of the boot: they stay in the
//! file, and no merge runs, as one would leave them out.
